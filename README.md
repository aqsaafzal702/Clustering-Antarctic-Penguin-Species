# Clustering-Antarctic-Penguin-Species
This project demonstrates the use of K-Means clustering on a penguin dataset to group penguins into distinct clusters based on their physical features. The dataset includes measurements of culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length, which were used to perform the clustering.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to identify patterns within the penguin dataset. By analyzing these patterns, we can gain insights into potential species or sub-species groupings based on physical characteristics.

## Key Steps
### Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values and normalizing the data.

### K-Means Clustering:
Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Performed K-Means clustering with the selected number of clusters.

### Visualization:
Visualized the Elbow Method to show the optimal cluster number.
Created scatter plots to display the clustering results.

### Analysis:
Analyzed the mean values of key features within each cluster to understand the physical traits associated with each group.

### Results
Optimal Number of Clusters: Determined using the Elbow Method.
Cluster Analysis: The penguins were grouped into clusters that reflect differences in culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

## Visualizations
Elbow Method
K-Means Clustering

## Conclusion
This project illustrates how K-Means clustering can be effectively used to classify penguins based on their physical attributes. The clustering reveals distinct groupings that could correspond to different species, providing a foundation for further biological research
